Still unsure on what to make, this is my current brainstorm! Currently working on using a hook to store scores.


Changelog
- 9/9/2021: Added a changelog and TODO section

TODO
- Add a button which increases a money counter on the screen 
- Add a basic graphic of a stick figure, striking a training dummy with a reducing health bar with a stick upon button click
- Add a button to upgrade the stick to a club, increasing score and reducing health bar by twice as much
- Add further buttons to upgrade the stick further
- (Maybe) Add an auto-click option for unlock
